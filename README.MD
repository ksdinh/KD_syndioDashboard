## Overview

This is my submission to the QA Interview Dashboard for Syndio

### Instructions to run test

To run locally you must first install Node. After installing Node run Cypress

1. `npm install` (install the requirements)
2. `npx cypress open` (start the application locally)
3.  Once Cypres is open, run the test named syndioDashboardSpec.cy.js

I ran the Syndio Dashboard on my localhost:3000
